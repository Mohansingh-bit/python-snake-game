# 🐍 Snake Game in Python

A classic **Snake Game** built using **Python Turtle Graphics**, demonstrating strong fundamentals of Python programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), event handling, and game logic.

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to move from basic syntax to building complete, interactive applications.


## 🎮 Game Overview

The player controls a snake using the keyboard.  
The objective is to eat food, grow longer, and score points while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake’s own body.


## ✨ Features

- 🟢 Interactive **Start Screen** with instructions  
- ⌨️ Smooth **keyboard controls**  
- 🍎 Random food generation  
- 🐍 Snake growth on eating food  
- 📊 Real-time score tracking  
- 💥 Collision detection (wall & self)  
- 🔊 Sound effects for eating and collisions  
- 🔁 **Restart game** option (Press `R`)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Turtle Graphics**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Event Handling**
- **winsound** (for sound effects on Windows)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Mohansingh-bit/python-snake-game
2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Folder
cd snake-game
3️⃣ Run the code
python main.py
⚠️ Note:
This project works best on Windows OS because it uses the winsound module.

🧠 What I Learned
